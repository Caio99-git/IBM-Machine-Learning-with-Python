🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Classifier
Welcome to the Rainfall Prediction Classifier, a machine learning project built as part of a data science course. In this project, I apply the full data science pipeline to build a classifier that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data.

🚀 Project Overview
As a data scientist at WeatherTech Inc., the goal is to leverage machine learning to help improve weather forecasting accuracy by predicting rainfall using historical meteorological data. The dataset includes features such as:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind speed

Rainfall measurements

And more

🔍 Key Tasks
Data Exploration & Cleaning
Performed exploratory data analysis, handled missing values, and engineered relevant features to improve model performance.

Model Building
Created a machine learning pipeline that includes model selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation
Assessed the model's performance using appropriate classification metrics and visualizations to interpret the results.

🧠 Techniques Used
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn for building and optimizing the classifier

Pipeline design for clean and reproducible ML workflow

Classification metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

📊 Outcome
The final model is capable of predicting whether or not it will rain tomorrow, providing insights that can be useful for agriculture, travel, and daily planning.
